# Rainwater Harvesting System using GIS

## Project Status: Completed (Local Files Too Large to Upload)

This project presents a fully implemented GIS-based Rainwater Harvesting System, completed as part of an academic initiative to use spatial analysis and environmental data to promote sustainable water management.

The system uses tools like QGIS/ArcGIS, remote sensing, and spatial hydrology to:
- Identify optimal catchment areas
- Analyze rainfall and runoff potential
- Design harvesting layouts and water storage structures
- Generate high-resolution maps and visual reports

## Why the Project Files Aren’t on GitHub

Due to the large size of GIS datasets (e.g., DEMs, satellite imagery, shapefiles, project layers), I am currently unable to host the complete files directly on GitHub.

These files include:
- Raster and vector layers
- Hydrological model outputs
- High-resolution maps and layouts
- GIS project files (`.qgz`, `.mxd`, etc.)

I am exploring options like sharing via Google Drive, Git LFS, or uploading a documentation-only version here.

## Sneak Peek (Coming Soon)

Screenshots and reports from the completed analysis will be uploaded here shortly.

## Key Learnings & Highlights

- Hands-on experience with DEM processing, slope and flow direction, and runoff estimation
- Real-world GIS pipeline from data acquisition to final layout design
- Used plugins and tools: SAGA, GRASS, Hydrology tools, GDAL, Raster Calculator
- Integration of rainfall statistics with terrain modeling to assess rainwater harvesting potential
